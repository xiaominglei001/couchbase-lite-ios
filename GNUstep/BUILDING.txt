GNUstep notes

use apt-get to install GNUstep itself

Stuff to prepare the shell:

    export CC=clang
    export CPATH=/usr/include/GNUstep
    export GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT=/usr/local/share/GNUstep
    export GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES=/usr/local/share/GNUstep/Makefiles

    . $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

Have to install CoreBase, a CF replacement
http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/CoreBase
Edited CFBase.h and CFDictionary.h

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev uuid-dev





#### OLD NOTES (2012)

If you haven't installed GNUstep yet, first follow the steps in SETUP.txt (which is basically a
shellscript but you might want to run the lines manually.)

Disclaimer: This has only been tested on Ubuntu Linux; YMMV on other platforms. I [Jens] am not a
Linux or GNUstep expert.

There is one small GNUstep patch needed that hasn't made its way upstream yet; you'll find that in
`fix_NSFileManager.patch`. You should apply that to `NSFileManager.m` in the `gnustep-base` source
directory and rebuild.

After that you should be able to cd to the TouchDB directory and enter
    make OPTFLAG= debug=yes
to build a debug version of TouchDB including unit tests. The output is "TouchDB.framework".

To run the unit tests, enter
    env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:TouchDB.framework/Versions/Current obj/TouchTool Test_All
which just tells the loader where to find the TouchDB library, then starts the TouchTool binary and
tells it to run all the unit tests.

To build a release version (optimized, no unit tests), enter
    make

If you need to debug the GNUstep Base framework, it helps to build and install a non-optimized
version of it. To do that:
    cd ~/gnustep-src/gnustep-base
    make OPTFLAG= debug=yes
    sudo -E make install
